Start working on implementing the button tray that reside below,
and scroll with the tiles. - actually I like the HUD design XD
buttons:
	1.)Generate Input
	2.)Select output file name
	3.)select transmission coefficients file (graphical system file
		browser?)
	4.)plotting placeholders
	5.) assets for the tray images 


MAKE TEXT BOX CLASS FOR BUTTONS - THINK ABOUT REWRITING TILES TO USE TEXT BOX
	AS A CLASS INSTEAD OF A MAGICAL PROPERTY OF TILES
