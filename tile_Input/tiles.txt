NGF
c 0 = use original (Caltech) values
c 1 = use original (Caltech) values
c 2 = use Kopecky-Uhl values for gamma ray strength, 
c 3 = Read in tabulated values for E1, M1, and E2 transmission coefficients.
c E1 values are read in as if L = 0 
c M1 values as if L = 1
c and E2 as if L = 2
c Thus, LMAX = 2 if all three are read in.
